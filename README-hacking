These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* Requirements

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the GIT repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges etc.), but imposes more
requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out sources.
Note the requirements to build the released archive are much less and
are just the requirements of the standard ./configure && make procedure.
Specific development tools and versions will be checked for and listed by
the bootstrap script.  See README-prereq for specific notes on obtaining
these prerequisite tools.

While building from a just-cloned source tree may require installing a
few prerequisites, later, a plain `git pull && make' should be sufficient.

* First GIT checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:
        $ git clone git://github.com/detwiler/detlibc.git
        $ cd detlibc

As an optional step, if you already have a copy of the gnulib git
repository on your hard drive, then you can use it as a reference to
reduce download time and disk space requirements:

        $ export GNULIB_SRCDIR=/path/to/gnulib

The next step is to get and check other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages:

        $ ./bootstrap

To use the most-recent gnulib (as opposed to the gnulib version that
the package last synchronized to), do this next:

        $ git submodule foreach git pull origin master
        $ git commit -m 'build: update gnulib submodule to latest' gnulib

And there you are!  Just

        $ ./configure --quiet [*]
        $ make
        $ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

        $ git diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!
